# HGCL-DR: A Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Drug Repositioning

Drug repositioning aims to identify new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. This repository contains the official implementation of **HGCL-DR**, a novel **heterogeneous graph contrastive learning** framework that effectively integrates both **global** and **local** feature representations for drug repositioning.

## üåü Highlights

- **Improved Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning**: Captures semantic consistency across heterogeneous relations.
- **Subgraph-Based Local Feature Learning**: Uses a bidirectional GCN and graph diffusion to model long-range dependencies.
- **Global-Local Fusion**: Contrastive learning enhances representation quality across different spaces.
- **Strong Performance**: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four benchmark datasets in AUPR, AUROC, and F1-score.
